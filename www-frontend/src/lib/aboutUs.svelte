          Who are we:<br/> DistrictCompass simplifies government access through an easy-to-navigate website. Our mission is to enhance community involvement by making government information accessible and encouraging people to engage with their community.
        </li>
        <li>Why do we need this: <br/>DistrictCompass helps the community access government information easily. Our analysis shows that, on average, 8% of a town's population searches for government-related information. Many existing websites are difficult to navigate. Our goal is to create a user-friendly site that consolidates government information, making it accessible to everyone. This empowers people to learn more about their community and become more engaged in local affairs.
