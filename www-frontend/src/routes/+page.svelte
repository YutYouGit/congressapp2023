    Welcome to District Compass! In the community, public participation in
    affairs pertaining to county and town governments is essential in order to
    properly participate in the democratic process and help create solutions to
    problems that may exist in your local community. Here at District Compass,
    we want to help fix this issue by informing those who want to know more
    about the towns of both Middlesex and Monmouth County. To do this, we
    created this website! It is designed in order to provide information about
    the departments and workings of both Monmouth County and Middlesex County.
    Explore the different towns of these counties and find more about them using
    our 3D Interactive model!
